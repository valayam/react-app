react app for demo

What are the pre requisites for developing a react app locally on my system and how to implement it

To develop a React app locally on your system, you need to have the following prerequisites:

Node.js and npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and npm is the Node package manager. You can download and install them from Node.js official website.

Code Editor: A code editor like Visual Studio Code.

Example Commands
# Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)
# Verify installation
node -v
npm -v

# Create a new React app
npx create-react-app my-app

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-app

# Start the development server
npm start

This will set up a new React application and start a development server, allowing you to begin developing your React app.
